# When High Performers Still Leave: A Systems View of Employee Turnover
I was trained in psychology to treat outcomes as clues, not explanations, which is why employee turnover has always bothered me more than most workplace metrics. Yet in organizational settings, I see patterns breaking that rule. In spite of those hitting targets, meeting expectations and being praised by supervisors, some still choose to leave. 

When employees quit while doing well, it raises questions. These moments point back to hidden pressures in the system. Stability does not always keep them around and the real cause hides earlier in the process. I didn’t start thinking about employee turnover because I love HR metrics. I started because the explanations always felt too neat. What leads someone to walk away?
## What I’m Curious About
What patterns appear when employees exit companies?

More specifically:
- Could it be that higher-rated performers walk away for reasons unlike those of their lower-rated performers?
  
- Do those just starting out face different stresses compared to employees who’ve been around longer in the organization?
  
- Do some teams see a sudden drop in employees in clusters despite solid individual metrics? Could quiet patterns beneath the surface explain it?

Instead of focusing on a single predictor, I plan to focus on how the context shifts the predictors' weight.
## Why This Matters to Me
Most of the time, turnover gets perceived as just a result or an outcome. An employee resigns, followed by some sort of reaction.
Looking at it through a psychology lens, things seem a little backward. When people leave at similar points in their careers, again and again, that pattern hints at deeper issues. Perhaps due to how tasks are set up, what gets praised, or how goals are shared within a company. Seeing each departure as just a personal choice hides the underlying trends. What seems like individual moves might actually reflect steady pressures built into the system. 

This project is my attempt to look at turnover as a system-level signal rather than an individual failure.
## The Data
I’m using a publicly available HR analytics dataset sourced from Kaggle that includes information on employee tenure, performance ratings, engagement indicators, department, and attrition status.
I’m treating this data as illustrative rather than representative. What matters here is spotting trends that make sense alongside known turnover theories about why employees leave organizations. If needed, I may also simulate small extensions of the data to test specific scenarios that aren’t fully captured in the original dataset.
## How I’m Approaching the Analysis
I’m keeping the analysis intentionally simple and interpretable. I plan to include:

- Looking at how turnover rates change across tenure and departments: People spend time on shifting jobs, leaving at different points. What department someone works at within an organization also shapes how long they stay.
  
- Looking at how turnover differs between top performers and low performers in an organization.
  
- Exploring how engagement relates to turnover differently depending on performance or career stage.
## What This Can’t Tell Us/Limitations
This is an exploratory analysis using cross-sectional and partially simulated data. Looking into patterns here means working with a snapshot of real information mixed, in some cases with made-up details. Though the numbers come from different sources, they help sketch out early observations without claiming full accuracy.

That means:
- I can’t make causal claims
  
- Measures may be noisy or incomplete
  
- Missing the real organizational context where such things happen
